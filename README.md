🕵️ TrueDetective

Think before you share

TrueDetective is a Misinformation Awareness & Online Trust platform designed to help users think critically about online content before sharing it.

Instead of labeling content as true or false, the platform focuses on awareness, context, and reasoning — encouraging responsible digital behavior.

🧠 Core Idea

We help users understand why content may be misleading —
we do not tell them what to believe.

The platform analyzes patterns such as:

claim structure (facts vs opinions)

emotional or manipulative language

missing context

verification guidance

Users always remain the final decision-makers.

🚀 Current Status

✅ Frontend UI completed (dashboard-style)

🟡 Backend (Node.js + Express) in progress

🟡 AI integration (Google Gemini) planned

🟡 Database (MongoDB) optional for later stages
